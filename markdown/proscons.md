#### Pros:
- Automated, CBSA staff do not need to provide any input
- Google Maps is an industry leader and has a lot of data
- This methodology is repeatable anywhere, supports splitting commercial and travellers if they are further apart
- No hardware is required
- The granularity of the polling rate can be modified
#### Cons:
- Each request costs money, ~ $0.002 USD per request.
- Accuracy has not been confirmed
- If there were a traffic jam to exceed the POE's trip length (~1km, depending on the nearest intersection), the actual wait time will not be estimated properly.
