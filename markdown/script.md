## Script
- A very light script runs every minute.
- Each minute, it looks up which sites are to be updated.
- For each site identified, it looks up which "profile" it belongs to
    - A profile determines how often a location is polled for wait times
    - These profiles can be defined by hour, for example:
        - From 12:00 AM to 7:00 AM, poll at a reduced rate
        - From 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM, poll often
        - From 7:00 PM to 12:00 AM, poll at a reduced rate
    - More complex profiles (based on weekdays, month for example) are possible but not currently implemented.
- If this location is due to be polled based on the profile, the request is sent to Google to estimate the wait times.
- The result is stored in a database (currently: MongoDB Cloud Atlas DB, free-tier)
